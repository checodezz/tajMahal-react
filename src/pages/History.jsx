            Constructed in the 17th century by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as a
            mausoleum for his wife Mumtaz Mahal, the Taj Mahal stands as an
            enduring symbol of love and devotion. Its construction took over 20
            years and involved thousands of artisans, making it one of the most
            magnificent architectural achievements of the Mughal Empire.

            Despite its beauty, the Taj Mahal has faced challenges such as
            environmental degradation and damage caused by pollution, which have
            affected its pristine white marble facade over time.
