            The architecture of the Taj Mahal is a sublime fusion of Persian,
            Islamic, and Indian architectural styles, showcasing intricate
            craftsmanship and meticulous attention to detail. Its symmetrical
            layout, highlighted by the iconic white marble dome and minarets,
            reflects a harmonious balance of geometric precision and aesthetic
            elegance, making it a timeless masterpiece of architectural design.
          </p>
          <p>
            The use of intricate marble inlay work, known as "pietra dura,"
            further enhances the Taj Mahal's architectural brilliance, with
            delicate floral and geometric motifs adorning its surfaces in a
            mesmerizing display of artistry.
